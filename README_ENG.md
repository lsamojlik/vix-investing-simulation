<h2 align="center">Problem Description</h2>

- A person without expert knowledge in investing wants to know when it is best to invest in the broad S&P 500 index.

- Their net monthly income is PLN 8,000, of which PLN 2,000 can be regularly allocated to investments.

- They are considering whether investing PLN 2,000 immediately after receiving their salary is the optimal solution.

- An alternative approach is considered: accumulating funds and investing them only during “market opportunities,” i.e., when market volatility (measured by the VIX index) reaches elevated levels.

- It is assumed that during periods of market uncertainty and high VIX, all accumulated funds are invested in an ETF tracking the S&P 500.

- Investment horizon: **5 years** (both strategies end exactly after 5 years).

---

<h2 align="center">Data and Methodology</h2>

- The analysis is based on historical data for the **S&P 500** and **VIX** indices from **January 2, 1990 to April 25, 2025**.  
  The start date reflects the beginning of official VIX publication.

- A total of **363 possible 5-year investment periods** were analyzed.

### Tested Strategies

- **Regular strategy**  
  Monthly investment of PLN 2,000.

- **VIX > 80th percentile**  
  Investing all accumulated funds when VIX exceeds the 80th percentile of historical observations.

- **VIX > 85th percentile**

- **VIX > 90th percentile**

- **VIX > 95th percentile**

> 423 months (January 1990 – April 2025) minus 60 months of investment = **363 simulations**

---

<h2 align="center">Results Summary</h2>

### Regular Strategy

- Average return over 5 years: **28.19%**
- Simple and stable approach
- No need for market timing or additional indicators

### VIX-Based Strategies

- Higher VIX thresholds lead to **higher average returns**

- Best result achieved for **VIX > 95th percentile**:
  - Average return: **31.04%**
  - Average number of investments: **less than 2 over 5 years**

- Fewer investment moments at higher VIX thresholds may:
  - Increase psychological pressure (FOMO)
  - Result in no investment if the threshold is never reached

- Return volatility (standard deviation) is comparable across all strategies:
  - Approximately **26–29%**

- **Drawdown analysis** indicates:
  - The **lowest average and maximum drawdown** for the **VIX > 95% strategy**
  - A smaller gap between peak and trough returns compared to other strategies

---

<h2 align="center">Conclusions</h2>

- **Regular investing** is suitable for investors who value simplicity, predictability, and consistent portfolio growth.

- **VIX-based investing** may appeal to investors seeking to exploit periods of heightened market volatility:
  - Potentially higher returns
  - Significantly lower drawdowns compared to the regular strategy
  - Fewer but more concentrated investment decisions

- During periods of market panic, signaled by an elevated VIX index, **reducing exposure may be suboptimal**.  
  If financial conditions allow, increasing exposure during such periods may improve long-term results.

- Avoiding investments during high volatility may lead to missing the most attractive market opportunities.
